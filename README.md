# Named-Entity-Recognition-Tensorflow
Implemented Bidirectional-LSTM  first and improving the F1score with Bidirectional Stacked LSTM 

Prerequisites
1:- ScikitLearn
2:- Tensorflow
3:- Pandas
4:- Numpy

Dataset is taken from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus


Motivation:- To test Different Deep Learning architectures (Bidirectional LSTM and Bidirectional Stacked LSTM) for Named Entity Recognition 
task 

Score:- Achieved  F1 Score of 0.86 by implementing Bidirectional LSTM Model with dropout  and further improved the  F1 Score to 0.91 by implementing Bidirectional Stacked LSTM model with dropout  for 5 epochs 

Improvement:-
1:- Running for more epochs
2:- Playing around with learning rate
